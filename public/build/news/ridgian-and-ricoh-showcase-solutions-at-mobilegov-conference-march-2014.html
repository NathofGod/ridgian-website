    <div class="news-article-content markdown-body"><p>We were thrilled to be asked to support Ricoh at the MobileGov event in London earlier this month.</p>
<p>The MobileGov event is an annual conference for Industry Specialists to discover and discuss new innovations in driving forward mobility across Government, examples of good practice, tools and experience to provide support and guidance for those initiating and implementing mobile working programmes.</p>
<p>With tablet sales expected to surpass PC sales by 2015, it is clear that the era of mobile working is now well established. The emergence of sophisticated tablet devices, smartphones and faster mobile internet connections have empowered the mobile worker. This is certainly true of the public sector, who need to turn to innovative technologies to implement efficiencies in order to ensure that in times of austerity, service levels still remain high. As Information Management experts, we have developed a number of business applications designed to accelerate mobile working and extend our Public Sector Information Management solutions out across devices.</p>
<p>Ridgian&#x2019;s Business applications put tools in the hands of employees to allow them quickly surface critical business information whether they are working on a desktop, tablet or mobile device. For example, we have developed a concept for delivery of our Troubled Families Dashboards to tablet devices via Window&#x2019;s 8- an invaluable enhancement to the solution. We were delighted to have the opportunity to showcase our solutions to such a varied Government audience and received an overwhelming response from delegates visiting us on our stand.
Moreover, the event served as the perfect opportunity to promote our much-valued Partnership with Ricoh, who we have been working very closely with in recent months to develop a Public Sector strategy. Ridgian and Ricoh work together to drive the future of information management by empowering customers with applications and data on their terms irrespective of location and form factor. Ridgian compliments Ricoh&#x2019;s long term strategic customer engagements by leveraging Microsoft technology to innovate and support the move to a digital, and always on world.</p>
<p>Ricoh were demonstrating some really impressive technology on the day, such as their 360 degree mobile camera, Theta.
We look forward to collaborating with Ricoh again during the coming months, we will keep the website posted of future events and initiatives so watch this space. </p>
